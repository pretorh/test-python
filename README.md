# Python project setup

Basic Python project as an example for how to setup a project.

## setup

basic:
- create a directory for the library in `src`
- create empty `__init__.py` ("required to import the directory as a package, and should be empty.")
- lint: ignore docstring issues (doc strings can be verbose)
